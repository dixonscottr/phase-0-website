<h1>The food of Sasayama</h1>
<p></p>
<h3>Black Beans</h3>
<p>The black soy beans of Sasayama can be turned into just about anything, from simple the simple bar snack of boiled edamame to deliciously interesting ice cream. Black beans are harvested in the fall and really turn their eponymous color when dried.</p>

<h3>Boar Meat</h3>
<p>Wild boars dot the countryside of Sasayama and are one of the delicacies in the area. Even the schools feature boar meat in their lunches every now and them. One of the official dishes of Sasayama is a hot pot filled with boar meat called <em>botan-nabe</em>. Entire restaurants are dedicated to serving <em>Botan-nabe</em>.</p>

<h3>Mountain Yam</h3>
<p>Despite its slimy appearance and questionable texture, the mountain yams of Sasayama area a great addition to any meal. Shredded mountain yams can be added to the top of a dish or mixed inside the savory <em>okonomiyaki</em> pancakes to make them fluffier.</p>

<h3>Shishamo Shiso Maki (grilled smelt wrapped in perilla leaves)</h3>
<p>While not techincally one of Sasayama's specialties, this dish of grilled smelt, or <em>shishamo</em>, wrapped in perilla leaves, or <em>shiso</em>, has been seen at local restaurants off and in since around 2009. Plenty of calcium, protein and greenery in these bad boys.</p>
